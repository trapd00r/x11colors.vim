# NAME

  x11colors.vim

# DESCRIPTION

This script highlights X11 color name strings with the appropriate color.
In gvim, the exact same color is used. In standard vim, an approximation is
used - there's only 240 colors to pick from.

It is however possible to achieve the exact same thing in standard vim. See
[colorcoke][0] for what's possible to do. It just needs someone to implement
it. That someone could be you!
